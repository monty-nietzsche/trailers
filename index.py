# [1]  IMPORT FILM DETAILS FROM FILE

# The movies' list exists in a file 'movies.dat'. The file is opened, and read
# line per line.Each line is transformed # into a row in our movies' list where
# each movie has a row.The file is a semi-colon separated file. The entries are
# respectively: Movie Title| Movie Director | Movie Genres | Movie Storyline |
# Movie poster link | Movie Youtube id (not a full link)| IMDB id.
# An example: [The Outsider; MARTIN ZANDVLIET; CRIME,DRAMA,MYSTERY;An epic set
# in post-WWII Japan and centered on an American former G.I. who joins the
# yakuza.;https://www.movie-list.com/img/posters/big/outsider2018.jpg;

#  [2]  CREATE MOVIE OBJECTS

# Instead of creating individual Movie objects, I created them dynamically from
# the movies' list created above. We just need to get rid of brackets and send
# the content of each line to the constructor. We get rid of brackets # through
# using (*movies_list[i]). Once an object is created, it is added to the array
# that contains all Movie objects.

# [3] SEND A REQUEST TO FRESH TOMATOES TO PREPARE PAGE, SAVE AND OPEN THE PAGE

# Once the objects array is full, it is sent to 'create_movies_page' a function
# in fresh_tomatoes file which we have imported above. The function creates the
# page and sends back the webpage.All we  need now is to save the data received
# into a file 'index.html' and open it.

# Collect the webpage from fresh_tomatoes

# Create or overwrite the output file
